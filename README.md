## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence focused on the interaction between computers and human languages. This repository provides Python implementations of various NLP techniques and algorithms, ranging from basic text processing to advanced topic modeling and language modeling.

## NLP Basics

### Synonyms and Antonyms

Explore methods for finding synonyms and antonyms of words in text.

### TF-IDF and Bag of Words (BOW)

Learn about text vectorization techniques, including TF-IDF and Bag of Words, for representing text data.

### N-Grams (Bi-Gram and Tri-Gram Language Modeling)

Understand the concept of N-grams and implement bi-gram and tri-gram language modeling.

### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging

Perform part-of-speech tagging to identify grammatical categories of words in sentences.

## Word Embeddings

### Word2Vec for Similarity

Use Word2Vec word embeddings to measure semantic similarity between words.

## Syntax and Parsing

### Parse Tree

Generate parse trees to analyze the syntactic structure of sentences.

## Text Classification

### Naive Bayes

Implement text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Perform text classification using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## Text Clustering

### K-Means

Apply K-Means clustering to group similar text documents.

## Topic Modeling

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

Use LDA for topic modeling to discover latent topics in a collection of documents.

### Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)

Apply LSA to uncover latent semantic structures in text data.

### Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

Utilize NMF for topic modeling and feature extraction.

## Text Summarization

Summarize text documents to extract key information.

## Language Modeling

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Implement language modeling using LSTM networks for sequence prediction.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract entities like names, locations, and organizations from text.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code for each NLP technique in their respective directories. You can use these implementations as reference, integrate them into your NLP projects, or use them for learning and experimentation.
